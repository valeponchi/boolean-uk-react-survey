Description
With this exercise, we're going to have some practice creating forms. They're not exactly the easiest or most fun to create, but they're everywhere! (We could even argue that the web isn't much more than a bunch of forms). This will also give you some hands-on time with creating controlled forms in React. 

Instructions
- Use this template => https://codesandbox.io/s/react-survey-form-starter-template-qgrgx
- Make sure you check all the code that was given to you
- Create the missing form, by following the templates in the templates folder, and by watching the gif
- The values of the checkboxes and radio buttons are repeated throughout the different sections of the form
- When the form is submitted, the answers should be stored in state
- Also, after submitting the form, you should reset the form to its original state 
- Display all the answers in the Answers List, using the provided components

Tips
- The form might look quite big, but there are opportunities here to reuse some of the components you create within the form
- Remember that in a controlled form, the state is the one keeping track of the inputs values

Challenge
Add an edit button to each of the answers cards. Clicking on this button should fill in the form with the current answers, and submitting the form should save the changes into the same card again.

Challenge 2
Add a json-server to your app, and persist all the answers from the form. You still should be able to edit the form and save the new answers too. Also, add a delete button to each of the answers that will delete them from the server too.
